# Whisper Wind

Whisper Wind is a simple Python-based text-to-speech (TTS) program that uses the `pyttsx3` library to convert text input into spoken words. The program continues to take user input until the user decides to quit by typing "q". When the program ends, it bids the user farewell with a message.
